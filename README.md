Heart attacks, a critical health concern, occur with alarming frequency in the United States. On average, someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds (Tsao et al., 2023). Approximately half of Americans have at least one of the three major risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol or smoking (Fryar et al., 2010). These statistics highlight the need for increased awareness, proactive prevention, and prompt medical intervention to combat this widespread health crisis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted annual Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys since 1984. BRFSS is a collaborative project between all the US states and US territories that collects data on health-related risk behaviours and chronic health conditions. This analysis focuses on the 2022 BRFSS survey (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2023). The survey included 400,000+ American adults and collected various variables that may contribute to heart attacks. The survey provided valuable insights into the factors influencing heart attack risks. 

The author removed the data points with missing values, leaving the dataset with 246,022 data points (Pytlak, 2023). The original survey by the CDC collected approximately 300 variables, narrowed down to 39 features deemed most relevant for heart attacks by the author. The target variable is ‘HadHeartAttack’, a binary outcome of either a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’, framing this as a classification problem. 

Numerous efforts have been made to develop machine learning models using this dataset in the discussion section on Kaggle, where the dataset was sourced from. However, these attempts have primarily been made by random individuals without established credibility in the field. Moreover, none of these attempts have been formally edited or published on any credible platform. However, many studies attempt to predict heart attack possibilities using different datasets. Tn et al. (2023) employed various machine learning algorithms on a separate dataset, and their findings suggested that chest pain (angina) and heart scans heavily correlate in predicting heart attacks.
